# PhyChiSim

**PhyChiSim** is a Godot-based Android mobile app for physics and chemistry simulation. Its current focus is on simplistic simulations for motion study, allowing visualization of related vectors and their magnitudes. The app currently supports the visualization of gravity, velocity, and normal reaction, making it a useful educational tool for students and teachers.

## Features

- Visualize physics simulations directly on your Android device
- Interactive motion studies with vector visualization (gravity, velocity, normal reaction)
- Object manipulation: instantiate, move, display vectors, and view values
- Modify object parameters via contextual menus
- Save and manage your simulations
- User-friendly dashboard and simulation library
